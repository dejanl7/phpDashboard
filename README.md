# phpDashboard <br> <p>For testing purposes, you can find example of this project in http://sdl-profile.com</p>
Dashboard is PHP project which involve 3 important parts. Before everything, I need to mention one note. Front-end part of applicaton is written in Serbian language because it will be used for Serbian market. Completelly back-end part and code comments are written in English. Everything that you need to do if you plan to use this application is to change html text into files.<br> 

<b>The first part</b> consists front-end pages where visitors can find companies and dashboard users can register and login into profile. <b>The Second part</b> is Admin area. When user register and login into account, dashboard will appear. <b>The third part</b> is Master Admin part. Master Admin part serve for managing with a network. There you can find all info about users. Also, you can block (deactivate) or allow (activate) approach to the network for some users. <br>
The Idea for creating phpDashboard is based on multiple functionality.<br><br>
<b>Admin area</b> involve two important parts. First part is related with editing website display. The second admin part represents dashboard functionality. <br><br>
